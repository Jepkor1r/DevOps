## Overview
DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a collaborative approach that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations. It aims to streamline the process of delivering high-quality software, automating workflows, and maintaining systems at scale. In this journey, I explore the core components of DevOps, from foundational Linux skills to advanced automation, continuous integration and delivery, and cloud infrastructure management.

## Goals and Objectives
The primary goals for my DevOps learning journey include:

- Mastering Linux: Deepen understanding of the Linux file system hierarchy, commands, and system administration skills.
- Polishing Programming Skills: Enhance proficiency in C and Python for scripting and automation tasks.
- Learning DevOps Tools and Techniques: Gain practical knowledge of DevOps tools and processes, including CI/CD, containerization, and configuration management.
- Completing Relevant Courses and Certifications: Finish Google Coursera DevOps courses and other curated educational resources by December 2024.
- Building Real-World Projects: Work on impactful projects, such as an image-based tomato disease detection system, to apply DevOps practices and showcase skills.
- Reading and Researching: Continue learning about DevOps trends, the future demand for DevOps, and the potential impacts of AI on the field.
## Learning Modules
1. Linux Fundamentals

- Understanding the Linux file system hierarchy and organization (e.g., /bin, /etc, /var, /usr, /home).
- Managing files and directories, permissions, and system processes.
- Learning file handling and manipulation commands (e.g., grep, awk, cut, and find).
- Bash scripting for automation, loops, and conditional statements.
- Mastering SSH and secure file transfers for remote operations.

#### Basic Commands:

Here are some essential Linux commands to get started:
- `ls` - Lists files and directories
- `cd` - Changes the directory
- `pwd` - Prints the working directory
- `cp` - Copies files or directories
- `mv` - Moves or renames files or directories
- `rm` - Removes files or empty directories


#### File System Structure:

Understanding the Linux file system hierarchy is key. Here are some important directories:

- For a deeper dive? Let's goooo!

**/**: Root Directory


**├── bin**: Essential binaries for system and user commands e.g ls, mv, and cp


**├── boot**: Boot loader files, including the kernel


**├── dev**: Device files, representing hardware (e.g., disks, USB)


**├── etc**: System-wide configuration files


**├── home**: User home directories (e.g., /home/user)


**├── lib**: Shared libraries and modules


**├── media**: Mount point for removable media (CD-ROMs, USBs)


**├── mnt**: Temporary mount point for filesystems


**├── opt**: Optional software packages


**├── proc**: Virtual filesystem for process and system info


**├── root**: Home directory for the root user


**├── run**: System information since the last boot


**├── sbin**: System administration binaries


**├── srv**: Service data (e.g., for web servers)


**├── tmp**: Temporary files (cleared on reboot)


**├── usr**: User applications and utilities


**│         ├── bin**: Binaries for user applications


**│         ├── lib**: Libraries for user applications


**│         ├── local**: Locally installed software


**│         └── share**: Shared resources (e.g., documentation)


**└── var**: Variable files, such as logs and databases


**|            ├── log**             # Log files


**|            ├── tmp**             # Temporary files that persist across reboots


**|            └── cache**           # Application cache data



#### Permissions and Ownership

File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, or execute files. 
Basic commands for permissions:
- `chmod` - Changes file permissions
- `chown` - Changes file owner
- `chgrp` - Changes group ownership
