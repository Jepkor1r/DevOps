## Overview
DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a collaborative approach that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations. It aims to streamline the process of delivering high-quality software, automating workflows, and maintaining systems at scale. In this journey, I explore the core components of DevOps, from foundational Linux skills to advanced automation, continuous integration and delivery, and cloud infrastructure management.

## Goals and Objectives
The primary goals for my DevOps learning journey include:

- Mastering Linux: Deepen understanding of the Linux file system hierarchy, commands, and system administration skills.
- Polishing Programming Skills: Enhance proficiency in C and Python for scripting and automation tasks.
- Learning DevOps Tools and Techniques: Gain practical knowledge of DevOps tools and processes, including CI/CD, containerization, and configuration management.
- Completing Relevant Courses and Certifications: Finish Google Coursera DevOps courses and other curated educational resources by December 2024.
- Building Real-World Projects: Work on impactful projects, such as an image-based tomato disease detection system, to apply DevOps practices and showcase skills.
- Reading and Researching: Continue learning about DevOps trends, the future demand for DevOps, and the potential impacts of AI on the field.
## Learning Modules
1. Linux Fundamentals

- Understanding the Linux file system hierarchy and organization (e.g., /bin, /etc, /var, /usr, /home).
- Managing files and directories, permissions, and system processes.
- Learning file handling and manipulation commands (e.g., grep, awk, cut, and find).
- Bash scripting for automation, loops, and conditional statements.
- Mastering SSH and secure file transfers for remote operations.
