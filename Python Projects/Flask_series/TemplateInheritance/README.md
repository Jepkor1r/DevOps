# **SERIES CONTINUATION..**
- We'll continue building from the third application **(Template)**.

- Inheritance is a such a blessing, don't you think so? Talk of generational wealth inheritance and the likes!

- Fortunately or unfortunately, right here we'll be doing **Template Inheritance**

- Jinja has a template inheritance feature that we can easily add a navigation bar. In essence, what we can do is move the parts of the page layout that are common to all templates to a **base template**, from which all other templates are derived.

- You could mmemonic base template as foundation where all other templates are derived from just as the navigation bar works right!

- In short, we can create additional pages for an application as derived templates from the same base.html template. Achieving all the pages of an application sharing the same look and feel without duplication.
