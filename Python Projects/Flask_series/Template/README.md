# **SERIES CONTINUATION..**
- We'll continue building from the second application **(Simple_Layout)**.

- - *AHAAA!Could you guess what's cooking next?*

- We getting better guys! Here we are going to learn how to generate more elaborate web pages that have complex structure and many more dynamic components.

- - *Good question: Why template?*
- Imagine how complex the code (in this simple_layaout example) will become when you add quote posts from users, which are going to constantly change.

- So, we can keep the logic of our application separate from the layout or presentation of our web pages and things would be much better organized. 

- A touch of Conditional statement and Loops in template will also be covered!
